# Music Player

A music player flutter plugin that uses the native api to
show the currently playing track with cover image and controls.

**This plugin is still in development. The Android implementation
is not finished yet.**

> **Warning**: This plugin is written in Swift and Kotlin, so make
> sure your project is setup to compile these languages.
> 
> The required iOS version for this plugin is `10.*` because some
> features to control the audio playback have only been introduced
> there.
